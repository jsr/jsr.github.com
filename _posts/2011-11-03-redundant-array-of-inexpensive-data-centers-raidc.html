Last week our CEO, Dwight, posted to his blog about <a href="http://dmerr.tumblr.com/post/12004195663/data-centers-are-too-reliable-sort-of">data center reliability</a>, positing that if we expected our data centers to fail more often than they do, that we would end up building systems that were more tolerant of failures. 

One of the things that's great about MongoDB is it's actually really easy to use this kind of setup. Most of the time when people ask about multi-data center deployments, they are thinking of 2 data centers.
