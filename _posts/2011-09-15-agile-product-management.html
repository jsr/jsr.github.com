OK so we all know about agile development in its various forms, but I haven't read many good articles about agile product management. Most things you read are some version of: 1) make a backlog, 2) work in short bursts, 3) ship continuously. None of this is wrong, in fact, I agree with it more and more every day.

But what this leaves out is the product management process that usually sits in font and behind of this. How do you decide what goes in that backlog? This is one of the key responsibilities of product management and is typically much more difficult than it sounds.
